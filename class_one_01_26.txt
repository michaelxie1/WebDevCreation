feature branch workflow- all feature developments should happen in a seperate branch
(same workflow as main branch) - once feature is developed- merge with main
main branch never has broken code
Encapsulating feature request - allows for pull requests and allows people to help you
Project has a bug- you can use a feature branch that fixes the issue (create an issue)
- Naming feature branches should relate to purpose (git doesn't make a technical distinction- be careful)
Main branch => finalized product
anything feature branch => tests and fixes problems that come up (distinction comes from developers)

Anytime a change is made on feature branch - immediately push so no overlap between the branches
(try to minimize merge conflicts)
-Create a separate branch feature/issue that is being worked on

git checkout- b new-feature

after creating feature branch locally, make sure you specify the upstream
git push -u origin branch-name 
merge pull request when finished- normally keep it open (its fine to keep it ope when ur ready to merge tho)
